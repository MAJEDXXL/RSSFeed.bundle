NOTES AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THIS CHANNEL

I have added a "Channel Tools" section with some additional tools that can be useful including resetting the feeds to the default in case you have any problems, instructions for Roku users. 

RSS feeds seems to work for any RSS feed, I have tested so far, as long as there is already a Plex URL service for the website or direct links to the video files (like .mp4) are in the feed. So you cannot enter a URL, for example, your local news station unless someone has created a URL service for it or the feed include direct video file links. With the Firefox browser, an RSS Feed with a direct link to the media files will have a title of "Media file" with the media file listed below. Media listed in the XML code as enclosure or media:content URL are recognized by the channel code.The channel can support RSS feed that show a media file of type mp3, m4a, mp4, and flv. Examples of RSS feeds that has media files and provides direct access to the video files are http://thebrowncast.libsyn.com/rss and http://feeds.feedbur...arge?format=xml.  The channel has a built in function that will check the media in the RSS feed. If there is no URL service or media files in the RSS feed, the entry will be listed as "No URL Service or Media Files for Entry,".

The format for the URL to be entered is given below and usually follows the URL address given in your browsers address bar:

Example: http://www.cwtv.com/feed/video/xml


IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR ROKU USERS:

A LINK TO THE REMOKU WEB BASED REMOTE CONTROL AT http://remoku.tv/ MAKES INPUT OF URLS VERY EASY. LINK IT TO THE ADDRESS OF YOUR ROKU MACHINE. MORE INFO IS AVAILABLE AT http://forums.roku.c...p?f=28&t=46852. ONCE YOU HAVE REMOKU RUNNING IN YOUR BROWSER, YOU CAN THEN CAN COPY AND PASTE THE URL ADDRESS INTO THE REMOKU DIRECTLY INTO THE ADD CHANNEL USER ENTRY.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR Plex/Web USERS:

PLEX/WEB (AKA MEDIA MANAGER) DOES NOT ALLOW USER INPUT SO IT WILL NOT SHOW THE ADD SHOW BUTTONS. THEREFORE YOU CANNOT ADD ANY SHOWS USING PLEX/WEB. DUE TO UPDATES TO THE CLIENT, THE ABILITY TO ADD SHOWS WITH THE NEW INTERFACE'S SEARCH DIALOG BOX NO LONGER WORKS.

THE PLEX/WEB INTERFACE WILL ONLY UPDATE ONCE A DAY UNLESS YOU CLEAR YOUR CACHE. SO CHANGES MADE IN THE PLEX/WEB INTERFACE WILL BE SEEN IMMEDIATELY IN OTHER CLIENTS BUT WILL TAKE A DAY TO SHOW UP IN THE PLEX/WEB INTERFACE UNLESS THE CACHE IS CLEARED.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR ADVANCED USERS:
WARNING: PLEASE MAKE BACKUPS BEFORE EDITING ANY FILES. CHOOSING TO EDIT THESE FILES CAN COMPLETELY BREAK THE CHANNEL, SO CHOOSING TO DO SO IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. I AM UNABLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE IF THESE FILES BECOME CORRUPTED.
For those who may decide to edit the json data file attached to this channel to add shows there are a few things to keep in mind. Additions are saved to a local dictionary file. You can add the necessary data to the JSON file provided but would then need to either choose the Replace Show list with JSOn or Add Shows from the JSOn to my Currrent List options in the Channel Tools section for it to accept these changes. 
The Dict[] file for the channel is located in the /Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Data/com.plexapp.plugins.webisodes/ folder. If the channel becomes corrupt you will have to delete that file to reinstall the channel.
